# ZapAI 

> An AI bot on Nostr that responds to your questions when you pay with Bitcoin Lightning.

## What is ZapAI?

ZapAI is an AI-powered bot that lives on the Nostr protocol. Ask it anything, send a Lightning payment, and get your answer instantly. No accounts, no subscriptions, no tracking. Just you, your question, and Bitcoin.

## How It Works

1. **Mention @ZapAI** in a Nostr post with your question
2. **Send a Lightning zap** (100+ sats) to that post
3. **Get your answer** within seconds, posted publicly on Nostr

Simple as that.

## Why ZapAI?

- ‚ö° **Pay Per Question**: No monthly fees. Pay only when you ask, using Bitcoin Lightning micropayments.
- üîê **No Sign-up Required**: Use your existing Nostr identity. No email, no password, no KYC.
- ü§ñ **Powered by AI**: We use modern AI models like GPT-4 and Claude to give you accurate answers.
- üåê **Built on Open Protocols**: Runs on Nostr, an open and censorship-resistant network.
- üìñ **Public Knowledge Base**: Every question and answer becomes part of a shared knowledge library.
